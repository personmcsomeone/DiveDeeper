Game elements/mechanics to impliment:
X   comabt 
X   moving to next level

    make separate header for structs ony, no functions
    add spells
    let monsters do more than just attack/miss
    add more monsters (20-40)
    add boss/high level monsters 
    make a function that checks what level of the dungeon you are on and returns a specific event
    add chance events like shrines, merchants, other adventurers, skill buffs
    GOLD
    let player choose class to start the game, determine starting stats
    Ascii art for creatures and events 
        monsters
        events
